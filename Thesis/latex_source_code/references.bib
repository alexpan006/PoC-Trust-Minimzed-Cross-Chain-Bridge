Zero-Knowledge Rollups ({ZK} Rollups) present a promising solution, bundling transactions off-chain and submitting validity proofs on-chain to enhance throughput and efficiency. In this work, we examine the technical underpinnings of {ZK} Rollups and stress test their performance in real-world applications in decentralized finance ({DeFi}). We set up a proof-of-concept ({PoC}) consisting of {ZK} rollup and decentralized exchange, and implement load balancer generating token swaps. Our results show that the rollup can process up to 71 swap transactions per second, compared to 12 general transaction by Ethereum. We further analyze transaction finality trade-offs with related security concerns, and discuss the future directions for integrating {ZK} Rollups into Ethereum's broader ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin has shown great utility around the world with the drastic increase in its value and global consensus method of proof-of-work ({POW}). Over the years after the revolution in the digital transaction space, we are looking at major scalability issue with old {POW} consensus method and bitcoin peak limit of processing only 7 transactions per second. With more companies trying to adopt blockchain to modify their existing systems, blockchain working on old consensus methods and with scalability issues can't deliver the optimal solution. Specifically, with new trends like smart contracts and {DAPPs}, much better performance is needed to support any actual business applications. Such requirements are pushing the new platforms away from old methods of consensus and adoption of off-chain solutions. In this paper, we discuss various scalability issues with the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain and recent proposals like the lighting protocol, sharding, super quadratic sharding, {DPoS} to solve these issues. We also draw the comparison between these proposals on their ability to overcome scalability limits and highlighting major problems in these approaches. In the end, we propose our solution to suffice the scalability issue and conclude with the fact that with better scalability, blockchain has the potential to outrageously support varied domains of the industry.},

	abstract = {Cross-chain bridges are essential decentralized applications ({DApps}) to facilitate interoperability between different blockchain networks. Unlike regular {DApps}, the functionality of cross-chain bridges relies on the collaboration of information both on and off the chain, which exposes them to a wider risk of attacks. According to our statistics, attacks on cross-chain bridges have resulted in losses of nearly 4.3 billion dollars since 2021. Therefore, it is particularly necessary to understand and detect attacks on cross-chain bridges. In this paper, we collect the largest number of cross-chain bridge attack incidents to date, including 49 attacks that occurred between June 2021 and September 2024. Our analysis reveal that attacks against cross-chain business logic cause significantly more damage than those that do not. These cross-chain attacks exhibit different patterns compared to normal transactions in terms of call structure, which effectively indicates potential attack behaviors. Given the significant losses in these cases and the scarcity of related research, this paper aims to detect attacks against cross-chain business logic, and propose the {BridgeGuard} tool. Specifically, {BridgeGuard} models cross-chain transactions from a graph perspective, and employs a two-stage detection framework comprising global and local graph mining to identify attack patterns in cross-chain transactions. We conduct multiple experiments on the datasets with 203 attack transactions and 40,000 normal cross-chain transactions. The results show that {BridgeGuard}'s reported recall score is 36.32{\textbackslash}\% higher than that of state-of-the-art tools and can detect unknown attack transactions.},

This research empirically analyzes gas price variations, mempool clearance rates, and block finalization times in Ethereum's proof-of-stake ecosystem using real-time data from Geth and Prysm nodes. We observe that high-fee transactions are consistently prioritized, while low-fee transactions face delays or exclusion despite {EIP}-1559's intended improvements. Mempool congestion remains a key factor in validator efficiency and proposal latency. We provide empirical evidence of persistent fee-based disparities and show that extremely high fees do not always guarantee faster confirmation, revealing inefficiencies in the current fee market. To address these issues, we propose congestion-aware fee adjustments, reserved block slots for low-fee transactions, and improved handling of out-of-gas vulnerabilities. By mitigating prioritization bias and execution inefficiencies, our findings support more equitable transaction inclusion, enhance validator performance, and promote scalability. This work contributes to Ethereum's long-term decentralization by reducing dependence on high transaction fees for network participation.},

Because the demand of micro payment in Bitcoin is expected to increase due to low remittance cost, it is important to quantitatively investigate how transactions with small fees of Bitcoin affect the transaction-confirmation time. In this paper, we analyze the transaction-confirmation time by queueing theory. We model the transaction-confirmation process of Bitcoin as a priority queueing system with batch service, deriving the mean transaction-confirmation time. Numerical examples show how the demand of transactions with low fees affects the transaction-confirmation time. We also consider the effect of the maximum block size on the transaction-confirmation time.},

This opens the question whether existing security analysis of Bitcoin's {PoW} applies to other implementations which have been instantiated with different consensus and/or network parameters. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantitative framework to analyse the security and performance implications of various consensus and network parameters of {PoW} blockchains. Based on our framework, we devise optimal adversarial strategies for double-spending and selfish mining while taking into account real world constraints such as network propagation, different block sizes, block generation intervals, information propagation mechanism, and the impact of eclipse attacks. Our framework therefore allows us to capture existing {PoW}-based deployments as well as {PoW} blockchain variants that are instantiated with different parameters, and to objectively compare the tradeoffs between their performance and security provisions.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of {CPU} power. As long as a majority of {CPU} power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

However, they currently exhibit high latencies and fail to handle transaction loads comparable to those managed by traditional financial systems. Layer-two protocols, built on top of layer-one blockchains, avoid disseminating every transaction to the whole network by exchanging authenticated transactions off-chain. Instead, they utilize the expensive and low-rate blockchain only as a recourse for disputes. The promise of layer-two protocols is to complete off-chain transactions in sub-seconds rather than minutes or hours while retaining asset security, reducing fees and allowing blockchains to scale.

We systematize the evolution of layer-two protocols over the period from the inception of cryptocurrencies in 2009 until today, structuring the multifaceted body of research on layer-two transactions. Categorizing the research into payment and state channels, commit-chains and protocols for refereed delegation, we provide a comparison of the protocols and their properties. We provide a systematization of the associated synchronization and routing protocols along with their privacy and security aspects.

This work analyses the evolution of the {LN} during its first year of existence in order to assess its impact over some of the core fundamentals of Bitcoin, such as: node centralization, resilience against attacks and disruptions, anonymity of users, autonomous coordination of its members. Using a network theory approach, we find that the {LN} represents a centralized configuration with few highly active nodes playing as hubs in that system. We show that the removal of these central nodes is likely to generate a remarkable drop in the {LN}’s efficiency, while the network appears robust to random disruptions. In addition, we observe that improvements in efficiency during the sample period are primarily due to the increase in the capacity installed on the channels, while nodes’ synchronization does not emerge as a distinctive feature of the {LN}. Finally, the analysis of the structure of the network suggests a good preservation of nodes’ identity against attackers with prior knowledge about topological characteristics of their targets, but also that {LN} is probably weak against attackers that are within the system.},

	abstract = {Today, payment paths in Bitcoin's Lightning Network are found by searching for shortest paths on the fee graph. We enhance this approach in two dimensions. Firstly, we take into account the probability of a payment actually being possible due to the unknown balance distributions in the channels. Secondly, we use minimum cost flows as a proper generalization of shortest paths to multi-part payments ({MPP}). In particular we show that under plausible assumptions about the balance distributions we can find the most likely {MPP} for any given set of senders, recipients and amounts by solving for a (generalized) integer minimum cost flow with a separable and convex cost function. Polynomial time exact algorithms as well as approximations are known for this optimization problem. We present a round-based algorithm of min-cost flow computations for delivering large payment amounts over the Lightning Network. This algorithm works by updating the probability distributions with the information gained from both successful and unsuccessful paths on prior rounds. In all our experiments a single digit number of rounds sufficed to deliver payments of sizes that were close to the total local balance of the sender. Early experiments indicate that our approach increases the size of payments that can be reliably delivered by several orders of magnitude compared to the current state of the art. We observe that finding the cheapest multi-part payments is an {NP}-hard problem considering the current fee structure and propose dropping the base fee to make it a linear min-cost flow problem. Finally, we discuss possibilities for maximizing the probability while at the same time minimizing the fees of a flow. While this turns out to be a hard problem in general as well - even in the single path case - it appears to be surprisingly tractable in practice.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2006.01418},
	abstract = {Lightning Network ({LN}) is a widely-used network of payment channels enabling faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions. In this paper, we outline three ways an attacker can steal funds from honest {LN} users. The attacks require dilating the time for victims to become aware of new blocks by eclipsing (isolating) victims from the network and delaying block delivery. While our focus is on the {LN}, time-dilation attacks may be relevant to any second-layer protocol that relies on a timely reaction. According to our measurements, it is currently possible to steal the total channel capacity by keeping a node eclipsed for as little as 2 hours. Since trust-minimized Bitcoin light clients currently connect to a very limited number of random nodes, running just 500 Sybil nodes allows an attacker to Eclipse 47{\textbackslash}\% of newly deployed light clients (and hence prime them for an attack). As for the victims running a full node, since they are often used by large hubs or service providers, an attacker may justify the higher Eclipse attack cost by stealing all their available liquidity. In addition, time-dilation attacks neither require access to hashrate nor purchasing from a victim. Thus, this class of attacks is a more practical way of stealing funds via Eclipse attacks than previously anticipated double-spending. We argue that simple detection techniques based on the slow block arrival alone are not effective, and implementing more sophisticated detection is not trivial. We suggest that a combination of anti-Eclipse/anti-Sybil measures are crucial for mitigating time-dilation attacks.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2204.08032},
	abstract = {After the success of the Bitcoin blockchain, came several cryptocurrencies and blockchain solutions in the last decade. Nonetheless, Blockchain-based systems still suffer from low transaction rates and high transaction processing latencies, which hinder blockchains' scalability. An entire class of solutions, called Layer-1 scalability solutions, have attempted to incrementally improve such limitations by adding/modifying fundamental blockchain attributes. Recently, a completely different class of works, called Layer-2 protocols, have emerged to tackle the blockchain scalability issues using unconventional approaches. Layer-2 protocols improve transaction processing rates, periods, and fees by minimizing the use of underlying slow and costly blockchains. In fact, the main chain acts just as an instrument for trust establishment and dispute resolution among Layer-2 participants, where only a few transactions are dispatched to the main chain. Thus, Layer-2 blockchain protocols have the potential to transform the domain. However, rapid and discrete developments have resulted in diverse branches of Layer-2 protocols. In this work, we systematically create a broad taxonomy of such protocols and implementations. We discuss each Layer-2 protocol class in detail and also elucidate their respective approaches, salient features, requirements, etc. Moreover, we outline the issues related to these protocols along with a comparative discussion. Our thorough study will help further systematize the knowledge dispersed in the domain and help the readers to better understand the field of Layer-2 protocols.},

	abstract = {As blockchain technology continues to transform the realm of digital transactions, scalability has emerged as a critical issue. This challenge has spurred the creation of innovative solutions, particularly Layer 2 scalability techniques like rollups. Among these, {ZK}-Rollups are notable for employing Zero-Knowledge Proofs to facilitate prompt on-chain transaction verification, thereby improving scalability and efficiency without sacrificing security. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity of {ZK}-Rollups has hindered an exhaustive evaluation of their efficiency, economic impact, and performance.

This paper offers a theoretical and empirical examination aimed at comprehending and evaluating {ZK}-Rollups, with particular attention to {ZK}-{EVMs}. We conduct a qualitative analysis to break down the costs linked to {ZK}-Rollups and scrutinize the design choices of well-known implementations. Confronting the inherent difficulties in benchmarking such intricate systems, we introduce a systematic methodology for their assessment, applying our method to two prominent {ZK}-Rollups: Polygon {zkEVM} and {zkSync} Era. Our research provides initial findings that illuminate trade-offs and areas for enhancement in {ZK}-Rollup implementations, delivering valuable insights for future research, development, and deployment of these systems.},

Moreover, the broader effects on the overall Ethereum ecosystem remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of the impact of {EIP}-4844 on consensus security, Ethereum usage, rollup transaction dynamics, and the blob gas fee mechanism. We explore changes in synchronization times, provide quantitative assessments of rollup and user behaviors, and deepen the understanding of the blob gas fee mechanism, highlighting both enhancements and areas of concern post-upgrade.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology has revolutionized industries by enabling secure and decentralized transactions. However, the isolated nature of blockchain ecosystems hinders the seamless transfer of digital assets across different chains. Cross-chain bridges have emerged as vital web3 infrastructure to address this challenge by facilitating interoperability between distinct blockchains. Cross-chain bridges remain vulnerable to various attacks despite sophisticated designs and security measures. The industry has experienced a surge in bridge attacks, resulting in significant financial losses. The largest hack impacted Axie Infinity Ronin Bridge, with a loss of almost {\textbackslash}\$600 million {USD}. This paper analyzes recent cross-chain bridge hacks in 2022 and 2023 and examines the exploited vulnerabilities. By understanding the attack nature and underlying weaknesses, the paper aims to enhance bridge security and propose potential countermeasures. The findings contribute to developing industry-wide standards for bridge security and operational resilience. Addressing the vulnerabilities and weaknesses exploited in recent cross-chain bridge hacks fosters trust and confidence in cross-chain interoperability.},

In contrast to the underlying blockchains, the bridges often provide inferior security guarantees and have been targets of hacks causing damage in the range of 1.5 to 2 billion {USD} in 2022. The current state of bridge architectures is that they are ambiguous, and there is next to no notion of how different architectures and their components are related to different vulnerabilities. Throughout this study, we have analysed 60 different bridges and 34 bridge exploits in the last three years (2021-2023). Our analyses identified 13 architectural components of the bridges. We linked the components to eight types of vulnerabilities, also called design flaws. We identified prevention measures and proposed 11 impact reduction measures based on the existing and possible countermeasures to address the imminent exploits of the design flaws. The results are meant to be used as guidelines for designing and implementing secure cross-chain bridge architectures, preventing design flaws, and mitigating the negative impacts of exploits.},

	abstract = {Since the inception of Bitcoin, a plethora of distributed ledgers differing in design and purpose has been created. While by design, blockchains provide no means to securely communicate with external systems, numerous attempts towards trustless cross-chain communication have been proposed over the years. Today, cross-chain communication ({CCC}) plays a fundamental role in cryptocurrency exchanges, scalability efforts via sharding, extension of existing systems through sidechains, and bootstrapping of new blockchains. Unfortunately, existing proposals are designed ad-hoc for specific use-cases, making it hard to gain confidence in their correctness and composability.

We provide the first systematic exposition of cross-chain communication protocols. We formalize the underlying research problem and show that {CCC} is impossible without a trusted third party, contrary to common beliefs in the blockchain community. With this result in mind, we develop a framework to design new and evaluate existing {CCC} protocols, focusing on the inherent trust assumptions thereof, and derive a classification covering the field of cross-chain communication to date. We conclude by discussing open challenges for {CCC} research and the implications of interoperability on the security and privacy of blockchains.},

As a result, {BitVM}2 ensures program correctness with just three on-chain transactions. {BitVM}2 significantly improves over prior {BitVM} designs by enabling, for the first time, permissionless challenging and by reducing the complexity and number of on-chain transactions required to resolve disputes.
